    -Notes-
This file should be a place to compile things I've learned in a readable way outside of the programs, and also to make any plans or etc.

- It might be a good idea to put this on my github account so that it is useful in job applications or whatever, and make ths and the discord bot public
- Start keeping the assembly code of each chapter or something, as example code, remember to change nasm command to take the asm file we're working on 
and assemble it to boot_sect.bin
